# About project
A mini-game written in the C++ programming language using the SFML graphics library. The essence of the game: the player - to score as many points as possible by jumping on platforms that are randomly generated and also collect coins (flies). The game is complicated by the fact that there are 5 types of platforms: a simple platform, a moving platform, a breaking platform (two) and a trampoline platform (in the form of a mushroom). To lose you must fall down the screen or get stung by a bee.
